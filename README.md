# RawJpgRemover

This program was written as Windows Form application in C#.

I built this program for photographers who taking photos in RAW and JPG simultaneously.

Since deleting RAW and JPG files manually can be a long process, this program will do the job easily and very fast, just delete one type file of pictures and run the program for the second file type.

You can use it for free, but if you want to use the code itself or some of it, please contact.

Please note: I don't have any warranty for your files.
